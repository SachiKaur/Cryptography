# Cryptography
Uses the same concept as the enigma machine where each char is moved to a corresponding char an n number of times. However, its better than the enigma machine due to the fact that the char can stay itself, their are more number of movements that the char is moved to and their are 4 different file with different movements where the files are chosen randomly

To use the program:
1) Open Cryptography.java
2) Either choose Encrypt or Decrypt from the Top Right Side
3) Enter text into the input box
4) Enter a number from 0 to 93 in the smaller box
5) Press Enter for your text to be Encrypted or Decrypted

Note:
The number must be the same as the number when encrypting the text for it to decrypt correctly
